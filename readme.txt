////////////////////
// INITIALIZATION //
////////////////////

When the program is run, you will be asked to activate the battery. To begin, you must enter 'y' as the response. Anything else will
abort the setup. Setup takes three inputs: The number of columns, the number of cages per column, and the number of floors. The 
appropriate number of each corresponding object will then be generated.

To create the conditions specified by the requirements please enter 1 for columns, 2 for cages per column, and 10 for floors. There 
are two hard coded scenarios which are provided for demonstration purposes, it is worth noting that they will run as long as there 
are a minimum of 1 column, 1 cage, and 10 floors.

After completing the initialization, the user will be prompted to select either the call button scenario or the floor button 
scenario.
